<b><i>Hi! My name is Ankur Sinha and Welcome to My Blog.</i></b> 
<b>First of all, I should explain a little about the Image of Popeye and why I think it to be Analoguos to the Blog. Spinach is what gives Popeye his strength. I think the Spinach Can is the Hardware available nowdays, and the Spinach itself is the Data. Popeye is like our Deep Learning Algorithm. That's All Folks and Happy Reading!!</b>

A Self-Taught Machine Learning and Deep Learning Enthusiast. An Avid Learner and a Cartoon Lover. I have worked on a number of projects and I thought it would be a good idea to blog about those. I have learned a lot of things just by reading other people's blog and I thought to do the same. Please feel free to point out my mistakes so that I can learn from it and improve my skills. Thanks!‚ù§
